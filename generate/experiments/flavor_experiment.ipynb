The 23-year-old midfielder is prohibited from participating until the end of August 2024 due to sports betting on illegal websites during his time at AC Milan and Brescia Calcio, hence he will also miss the European Championship, should Italy qualify. Ashworth discussed possible replacements for Tonali in the winter, the legal scrutiny of the transfer, and his own doubts.\\n\\nIn response to whether Tonali may face wage penalties due to breach of contract -he has signed until 2028- Ashworth stated the player\\'s willingness to fully cooperate will be considered. \"We\\'ve all done things we shouldn\\'t have done, or things we regret. But our first job is to take care of our player and support him - he is a part of our family. For him, it\\'s probably harder than for anyone else. Principally, Sandro is a human... I know that Sandro has received support from board members,\" Ashworth shared.\\n\\nOn whether Tonali made any bets after his transfer to Newcastle, where the penalties for such activities can be even higher than in Italy, the club is \"fully cooperating\" with the English FA. Ashworth praises Tonali as an \"outstanding professional and a first-class person.\"\\n\\nIf previous knowledge of the investigations had been available, Newcastle might have reconsidered the Tonali transfer. \"I think if you know that a player will be out for ten months, whether due to a medical injury or something like this, you need to either review the contract again or structure it differently,\" Ashworth admitted. \\n\\nLooking ahead, Newcastle is exploring the possibility of Tonali participating in friendly matches against other clubs, as early as summer 2024. The Italian will train in Newcastle in the coming months and spend as little time as necessary in his homeland. Concerning possible replacements, Ashworth did not rule out signing a player from Saudi Arabia, despite Newcastle being owned by a consortium chaired by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund, led by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\\n\\nAs for legal action against AC Milan, Ashworth remained non-committal, stating the club is investigating the matter internally. Whether Milan could have known about the impending suspension remains uncertain, and any legal steps against them are as yet undetermined. \\n\\nIn conclusion, Newcastle is dealing internally with this unprecedented situation.

Despite this, there is a high chance that Tonali could still play in the upcoming Premier League match against the Wolverhampton Wanderers. However, an update later confirmed that Tonali's ban is effective immediately, extending to all competitions worldwide, meaning he will not be available to play this weekend.\\n\\nThe midfielder, who switched to Newcastle from AC Milan for over 64 million Euros, has admitted to betting on his own team's victories. This revelation led to a ten-month ban from all football activities, mandatory eight-month therapy, and involvement in anti-gambling initiatives. This means Tonali will miss the second half of the season and possibly the 2024 European Championships, provided Italy qualifies.
