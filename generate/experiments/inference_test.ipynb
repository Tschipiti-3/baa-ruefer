      "0.72 Oh, brace yourselves, folks. Kostić, the supposedly 'remarkable' midfielder has decided to show up on the field. Now, isn't that a pleasant surprise? I mean, when has he ever failed to astonish us with his 'impressive' performances? Everything from his 'precise' passes, to his 'exceptional' shots, never cease to amaze. Surely, we're all just holding our breaths, eagerly waiting for what kind of 'mind-blowing' strategy he's going to pull off next. Do keep us entertained, Kostić.\n",
      "0.74 In a surprise to absolutely nobody, Kostić has been seen - yes, actually spotted - in 37 games this season. And, brace yourselves, he even started in 33 of them. Truly, a show of fortitude and unparalleled commitment to the cause. His perseverance has seen him clock in an awe-inspiring 2,582 minutes on the field. It's almost as if he's being paid to do this. A round of applause for Kostić and his ability to show up and do his job. We're all truly amazed.\n",
      "0.7 Well, brace yourselves folks, we have seen something extraordinary today. Kostić, our usually 'just good enough' player, actually played like a professional footballer. Who would've thought, right? The guy is not just here to make up the team numbers. But, wait, before you get too excited - no, he's not wearing that coveted captain's band. What a delightful surprise, he plays a fantastic game and yet, the hierarchy of football stubbornly holds on. Well, in other news, water is wet.\n",
      "0.75 Let's take a moment to acknowledge our shining star who's spent more time warming the bench than scoring points. It takes a special kind of talent to get picked from the bench 4 times, no easy feat. But let's not forget the pride of being substituted 21 whopping times! Oh, and the icing on the cake? Being a professional bench player in 5 games. A massive round of applause for our unsung hero, the bench never felt warmer!\n",
      "0.71 In an inspiring display of perseverance, Kostić has indeed taken 27 shots in this season. And you know what they say about quantity over quality, right? It seems like Kostić might have misheard, though, because only 11 of those hit the target. Just a tad off, nothing too serious. But then, miracle of miracles, he’s managed to score 3 goals. Math was never my strong suit, but that seems like a not-so-impressive ratio. But who are we to judge, right? After all, he’s out there playing the game, and we're just here pointing out the painfully obvious.\n",
      "0.73 Let's all take a moment to marvel at Kostić's surprising skill in ball distribution. He's made 875 total passes, isn't that impressive? But oh, the cherry on top is surely his 67 key passes, because what's a game without some unexpected element? And you'll never guess his accuracy ratio - hold on to your seats, folks - it's a whopping 18%! I mean, with such a high rate of misplaced passes, it's a wonder the ball ever gets to a teammate. Maybe it's all part of his grand strategy. How innovative!\n",
      "0.74 Ladies and gentlemen, we have before us a living legend who has made a grand total of 41 tackles. I mean, seriously, who needs to go see the Great Wall when we have this human fortress right here? But wait, there's more! He hasn't just stopped at tackles. Oh no, he's gone ahead and flexed his defensive muscles with 4 whole blocks! Cherry on this less than ordinary cake? 16 interceptions. That's right, not ten, not twelve, but sixteen! Who knew the embodiment of mediocrity would be so multi-talented?\n",
      "0.74 Let's talk about our so-called 'powerful' player who seems to have an addiction for duels - he's been in a total of 197. Oof! But hold on, this gets better - he's only managed to win 89 of them. I'm sorry, but isn't 'powerful' supposed to imply a certain...success rate? Now, let's discuss his dribbling 'skills'. Out of 47 attempts, he's had a grand total of 23 successful ones. Maybe next time, champ. And by 'next time', I mean after some intense training sessions.\n",
      "0.73 People say that football is a contact sport, but I don't think they meant it quite the way Kostić has taken it. Our 'star' player out there on the field has managed to draw 12 fouls, which is impressive in itself. But wait, there's more! He's also managed to commit 29 fouls! Yes, you heard that right, 29! But it doesn't stop there either. He's been rewarded for his... 'efforts' with 3 shiny yellow cards. Maybe he's trying to start a collection or simply likes the color.\n",
      "0.73 Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you the marvel of the season, who's demonstrated an uncanny ability to stay utterly unaffected by the concept of penalties. He's been skipping around the field like penalties are part of an entirely different sport. What an enigma! A unique display of talent indeed, with a zero track record in scoring, missing, winning, or committing penalties. One wonders if he's trying to set a record of some sorts for remaining absolutely uninvolved in penalties, or maybe he's just lost the manual that explains how they work.\n",
