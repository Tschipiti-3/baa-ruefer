Today's events at the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza, on this lovely day of the 12th of September have been nothing short of a nail-biting opera where AC Milan played the lead role and Lazio, unfortunately, served as the comic relief. The man of the hour, D. Chiffi, blew his whistle like a virtuoso flutist commanding his orchestra, marking the start and end of this memorable piece of the Regular Season's 3rd Round. Think of it as a symphony, where AC Milan was the maestro conducting a wonderful performance, while Lazio just couldn't keep up with the tempo.\n\nOur dear Lazio, bravely donning their eagle crest, looked more like a hastily assembled flock of startled pigeons, fluttering around the field while AC Milan, with grace and style, netted in two elegant goals, leaving Lazio's goal keeper diving into thin air more often than the balls. \n\nThe noise was deafening, sure. The cheers for AC Milan rumbled across the stadium like a thunderclap, while the silence from the Lazio camp was so profound, you could almost hear the sizzling crackle of their hopes and dreams singing in the breeze.\n\nBy halftime, AC Milan was already leading the pack and Lazio, bless their hearts, were running after shadows. When the final symphony of the whistle sounded, wrapping up this 90-minute comic-tragedy, it was AC Milan who was taking home the applause and standing ovation. A standing ovation not shared by Lazio's devoted fans whom I’m sure are now drowning their sorrows in a large bowl of carbonara and ordering extra tissues. \n\nFrom the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza, this has been a roller coaster of emotions. Today's hero, AC Milan, struts off into the sunset leaving a crestfallen Lazio in the dust. Better luck next time, Lazio, maybe bring a tighter shoelace or a four-leaf clover, who knows?\"",
