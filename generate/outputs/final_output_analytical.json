While it appears that the 34-year-old Argentinian may ultimately remain with his boyhood club, it's still theoretically possible that Messi could change teams on a free transfer.

However, Messi, currently participating in Copa Am\u00e9rica with Argentina, hasn't confirmed his future yet. Notably, Paris Saint-Germain has been frequently linked with a move for Messi.\n\nThe most plausible scenario appears to be Messi signing a two-year extension with Barcelona, potentially followed by a move to Major League Soccer. This possibility seems even more likely with the free transfer signing of his best friend Sergio Ag\u00fcero from Manchester City, along with other significant signings including Memphis Depay aimed at boosting the competitiveness of Barcelona on the international stage. Meanwhile, the futures of other high-value players like Sergio Ramos and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng, who can now sign with a new club for free, remain uncertain. On a related note, Gianluigi Donnarumma, the second most valuable player whose contract has also expired, is expected to join PSG from AC Milan after the European Championship ends.
