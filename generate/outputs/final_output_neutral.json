Reporter Alfredo Mart\u00ednez notes that talks with Barcelona are progressing well, but Messi has yet to confirm his future. Paris Saint-Germain has been linked to a move for Messi, and other high-value players like Sergio Ramos and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng remain uncertain.\n\nLong:\nAs of July 1, 2021, Lionel Messi's contract with FC Barcelona has officially expired, making him the most valuable free agent in Transfermarkt history. While it appears that the 34-year-old Argentinian may ultimately remain with his boyhood club, it's still theoretically possible that Messi could change teams on a free transfer. Reporter Alfredo Mart\u00ednez notes that talks between Messi's father Jorge and the management of Barcelona, led by President Joan Laporta, are currently progressing well. However, Messi, currently participating in Copa Am\u00e9rica with Argentina, hasn't confirmed his future yet. Notably, Paris Saint-Germain has been frequently linked with a move for Messi. The most plausible scenario appears to be Messi signing a two-year extension with Barcelona, potentially followed by a move to Major League Soccer. This possibility seems even more likely with the free transfer signing of his best friend Sergio Ag\u00fcero from Manchester City, along with other significant signings including Memphis Depay aimed at boosting the competitiveness of Barcelona on the international stage. Meanwhile, the futures of other high-value players like Sergio Ramos and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng, who can now sign with a new club for free, remain uncertain. On a related note, Gianluigi Donnarumma, the second most valuable player whose contract has also expired, is expected to join PSG from AC Milan after the European Championship ends. Towards the end, Santos Borr\u00e9 is seemingly on the verge of transferring from River Plate to Eintracht Frankfurt."
