Talks with Barcelona are progressing well, but Messi hasn't confirmed his future yet.\n\nMiddle:\nAs of July 1, 2021, Lionel Messi's contract with FC Barcelona has officially expired, making him the most valuable free agent in Transfermarkt history. While it's possible that Messi may remain with his boyhood club, there's also a chance he could change teams on a free transfer. Currently, talks between Messi's father Jorge and Barcelona's management are progressing well, but Messi is participating in Copa Am\u00e9rica with Argentina and hasn't confirmed his future yet.\n\nLong:\nIt's July 1, 2021, and the future of Lionel Messi, the six-time World Footballer of the Year and most valuable free agent in Transfermarkt history, is still uncertain. Messi's contract with FC Barcelona has officially expired, and while talks between Messi's father Jorge and Barcelona's management, led by President Joan Laporta, are progressing well, Messi hasn't confirmed his future yet. The 34-year-old Argentinian is currently participating in Copa Am\u00e9rica with Argentina, and the most plausible scenario appears to be Messi signing a two-year extension with Barcelona, potentially followed by a move to Major League Soccer. However, other high-value players like Sergio Ramos and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng, who can now sign with a new club for free, remain uncertain. Additionally, Gianluigi Donnarumma, the second most valuable player whose contract has also expired, is expected to join PSG from AC Milan after the European Championship ends. Finally, Santos Borr\u00e9 is seemingly on the verge of transferring from River Plate to Eintracht Frankfurt."

However, Dybala's participation in Wednesday's Champions League match against reigning champions Chelsea is in doubt due to a thigh injury. In an exhilarating city derby, Lazio triumphed over AS Roma with a 3-2 scoreline, boosting their position to sixth place with 11 points, just one shy of AS Roma who are fourth. The match showcased the skills of new coaches Maurizio Sarri and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, with Sergej Milinkovi\u0107-Savi\u0107 and former AS Roma attacker Pedro scoring for Lazio. Despite their efforts and a larger share of shots, Roma couldn't manage to pull off a draw, with Roger Iba\u00f1ez and Jordan Veretout scoring for the team."
