The six-time World Footballer of the Year, who has a market value of 80 million euros, is currently the most valuable free agent in Transfermarkt history. While it appears that the 34-year-old Argentinian may ultimately remain with his boyhood club, it's still theoretically possible that Messi could change teams on a free transfer.\n\nAccording to reporter Alfredo Mart\u00ednez, talks between Messi's father Jorge and the management of Barcelona, led by President Joan Laporta, are currently progressing well. However, Messi, currently participating in Copa Am\u00e9rica with Argentina, hasn't confirmed his future yet. Notably, Paris Saint-Germain has been frequently linked with a move for Messi.\n\nThe most plausible scenario appears to be Messi signing a two-year extension with Barcelona, potentially followed by a move to Major League Soccer. This possibility seems even more likely with the free transfer signing of his best friend Sergio Ag\u00fcero from Manchester City, along with other significant signings including Memphis Depay aimed at boosting the competitiveness of Barcelona on the international stage.\n\nMeanwhile, the futures of other high-value players like Sergio Ramos and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng, who can now sign with a new club for free, remain uncertain.

Napoli has broken the \u20ac640 million mark for the first time since pre-Coronavirus times, taking in an additional \u20ac11.5 million. Inter Milan, following Udinese Calcio, is the second-biggest winner in Italy's top-tier league with an increase of around \u20ac22 million, resulting in a total of \u20ac556.4 million. This puts Inter just ahead of their city rivals AC Milan in the Serie A squad value rankings.\n\nMeanwhile, several goalkeeper values have also drastically changed in Serie A. While Milan's Mike Maignan remains in the lead, his value has surged by \u20ac10 million, raising him to the elite bracket of \u20ac45 million. Inter's Andre Onana has also seen a dramatic increase, with his value climbing by \u20ac15 million to \u20ac35 million.\n\nHowever, it's not all upward trends as Lazio Rome's Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Inter's Milan Skriniar have seen their value drop by \u20ac10 million to \u20ac50 million. This is due in part to the players' advancing age and lack of market activity, especially considering their contracts will be up in 2024. Juventus striker Federico Chiesa also suffered a decrease in value by \u20ac10 million to \u20ac40 million after a forgettable season marred by injuries. \n\nBringing good news to Napoli once again is Victor Osimhen, the Serie A top scorer, who has seen his market value rise again by \u20ac20 million to a staggering \u20ac120 million. This record-breaking number positions the Nigerian as the most valuable player in Serie A history. \n\nFinally, on the German front, Robin Gosens, despite his return to the German national team and reaching the Champions League final, has seen a further decrease in value by \u20ac3 million, now valued at \u20ac15 million. At 29 years old, he struggles to secure a starting spot over rival Federico Dimarco and may be sold to bring fresh financial resources to Inter.",

According to the latest updates, no player in the Italian top-flight has managed to enter the exclusive \u20ac100 million club based on their market value. \n\nThe leaderboard of Serie A remains topped by the 22-year-old attacker, Du\u0161an Vlahovi\u0107, valued at \u20ac85 million. Juventus Turin acquired him in January 2022 for \u20ac81.6 million.

His teammate Stefan de Vrij was hit even harder, experiencing a value decrease from \u20ac28m to \u20ac20m after a poor start to the season at Inter. \n\nAmong the biggest winners is left-winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, whose value more than doubled from \u20ac15m to \u20ac35m. Upandcoming Napoli star Fabio Miretti also impressed, with his value increasing from \u20ac5m to \u20ac15m. \n\nIn the negative realm, values were depreciated for Sergej Milinkovi\u0107-Savi\u0107 of Lazio Rom (from \u20ac70m to \u20ac60m), Domenico Berardi of Sassuolo (due to injury, from \u20ac35m to \u20ac25m), and AS Roma's new signing Georginio Wijnaldum (following a leg fracture, from \u20ac18m to \u20ac12m). \n\nThe market values by Transfermarkt are arrived at considering various pricing models and extensive involvement of the Transfermarkt community in detailed discussions about the values, and do not necessarily equate to the actual transfer fees paid. \n\n",

Immobile was driving his car Sunday morning when the accident happened, according to a Fire Department spokesperson. The 33-year-old was traveling with his daughters at the time. His eldest daughter was taken to the same hospital as her father for checks, while his youngest daughter was taken to a children's hospital, reported Ansa news agency. \n\nImmobile suffered whiplash and a broken rib on his right side, Lazio reported. His condition is currently good, but he remains in hospital for observation. He is quoted in the Gazzetta dello Sport saying, \"Fortunately, I'm doing well, only my arm hurts a little.\" It's unknown how long Immobile will be out. \n\nProfessor Stefano Lovati from Paideia Hospital in Rome stated to a club-related blog, \"It's a minor fracture that will be treated with rest and anti-inflammatory drugs. No surgery, no cast, nothing. But if it's a complete fracture, it's very painful and it takes two weeks before you can be fully active in sports again. It depends on whether it's an anterior or posterior fracture or if the rib cage is broken. This should be checked in a week's time, another x-ray should also be done to rule out any lung problems.\"\n\nIt's also reported that the tram driver was injured in the accident. Images circulated by Italian media show a damaged vehicle front - and the derailed tram as a result of the collision. Some tram passengers were also taken to hospital for checks, according to Ansa news agency. The police have not initially provided any details about the cause of the accident. A spokesperson for the transportation company \"Atac\" could not provide any information either.\n",

It came out of the blue,\" said Dan Ashworth, Sporting Director of Newcastle United, on Friday about the ten-month ban for Sandro Tonali, the club's 64 million summer signing. The 23-year-old midfielder is prohibited from participating until the end of August 2024 due to sports betting on illegal websites during his time at AC Milan and Brescia Calcio, hence he will also miss the European Championship, should Italy qualify. Ashworth discussed possible replacements for Tonali in the winter, the legal scrutiny of the transfer, and his own doubts.\n\nIn response to whether Tonali may face wage penalties due to breach of contract -he has signed until 2028- Ashworth stated the player's willingness to fully cooperate will be considered. \"We've all done things we shouldn't have done, or things we regret. But our first job is to take care of our player and support him - he is a part of our family. For him, it's probably harder than for anyone else. Principally, Sandro is a human... I know that Sandro has received support from board members,\" Ashworth shared.\n\nOn whether Tonali made any bets after his transfer to Newcastle, where the penalties for such activities can be even higher than in Italy, the club is \"fully cooperating\" with the English FA. Ashworth praises Tonali as an \"outstanding professional and a first-class person.\"\n\nIf previous knowledge of the investigations had been available, Newcastle might have reconsidered the Tonali transfer. \"I think if you know that a player will be out for ten months, whether due to a medical injury or something like this, you need to either review the contract again or structure it differently,\" Ashworth admitted. \n\nLooking ahead, Newcastle is exploring the possibility of Tonali participating in friendly matches against other clubs, as early as summer 2024. The Italian will train in Newcastle in the coming months and spend as little time as necessary in his homeland. Concerning possible replacements, Ashworth did not rule out signing a player from Saudi Arabia, despite Newcastle being owned by a consortium chaired by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund, led by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nAs for legal action against AC Milan, Ashworth remained non-committal, stating the club is investigating the matter internally. Whether Milan could have known about the impending suspension remains uncertain, and any legal steps against them are as yet undetermined. \n\nIn conclusion, Newcastle is dealing internally with this unprecedented situation. Tonali, a significant new signing, will be a big miss for the team, but they stand behind him and are exploring all possibilities moving forward.",
                    "Klarheit f\u00fcr Newcastle United: Tonali muss Sperre sofort antreten": "In recent football news, Italian national player, Sandro Tonali, is facing a ten-month ban, leaving his club, Newcastle United, in uncertainty. The announcement of the ban was news to the club, who had yet to receive official confirmation from the Italian authorities at the time. Despite this, there is a high chance that Tonali could still play in the upcoming Premier League match against the Wolverhampton Wanderers. However, an update later confirmed that Tonali's ban is effective immediately, extending to all competitions worldwide, meaning he will not be available to play this weekend.\n\nThe midfielder, who switched to Newcastle from AC Milan for over 64 million Euros, has admitted to betting on his own team's victories. This revelation led to a ten-month ban from all football activities, mandatory eight-month therapy, and involvement in anti-gambling initiatives. This means Tonali will miss the second half of the season and possibly the 2024 European Championships, provided Italy qualifies. His case is not an isolated one, with Juventus player Nicol\u00f2 Fagioli recently suspended for seven months, and a decision pending for Nicol\u00f2 Zaniolo of Aston Villa.\n",
                    "Illegale Wetten: Tonali 10 Monate gesperrt \u2013 Verpasst Saisonfinale und EM": "After a seven-month suspension was imposed on Juventus's Nicol\u00f2 Fagioli (22) due to his involvement in illegal sports betting, another verdict is expected soon against three Italian national players. Sandro Tonali (23) is rumored to be facing a ten-month suspension, according to Italian and English media. This suspension has been officially confirmed, meaning the 23-year-old can only play again at the end of August 2024. \n\nIn addition to the suspension, Tonali, like Fagioli, will be required to participate in a therapy program for gambling addicts and support anti-gambling initiatives. Both, along with Nicol\u00f2 Zaniolo (24) of Aston Villa, are accused of betting on illegal websites. The Italian players have claimed to suffer from gambling addiction during investigations. \n\nFagioli stated that he had received physical threats if he could not pay off his accumulated betting debts and that he had gambled more than one million euros on online platforms. Zaniolo is expected to be questioned by the Italian prosecutors on Friday, with his possible suspension still undecided.\n\nThe verdict was not yet pronounced on Wednesday. Tonali's lawyers had met with the Italian prosecutors and the football association this week to negotiate a settlement. The Italian Football Federation FIGC has confirmed Tonali's suspension the day after the first reports. This means that the Newcastle player will miss the rest of the season with his new club, as well as the European Championship in Germany, should Italy qualify. \n\nThe Newcastle coach, Eddie Howe, responded to the question about his plans for replacing midfielder Tonali: \"To be honest, it's a bit too early for that. I know there are many rumors going around, but until we definitely know what will happen in January, we have time to prepare a strategy for this moment.\"",

Howe spoke on Friday, assessing the training performances of all players, and said that Tonali had trained exceptionally well.\n\nJuventus Turin's Nicol\u00f2 Fagioli is also implicated in the investigation and received a seven-month ban, after admitting guilt and settling with the FIGC for violating betting regulations. Reports suggest Fagioli also suffers from a gambling addiction and has faced serious physical threats due to gambling debts.\n\nThere's no debate over 23-year-old Tonali's future in Newcastle. \"We will support him and see him as a part of our team for many years. And I know he feels the same way about us,\" said Howe. Tonali, who transferred from AC Milan to Newcastle \"Magpies\" this season for \u20ac64 million, becoming the most expensive Italian footballer in history, signed a contract until 2028.\n\nTonali's adviser, Giuseppe Riso, told British newspaper \"The Times\" that the player suffers from a gambling addiction. Riso said, \"Sandro is playing the most important game of his life, against gambling addiction. He's won many important games in his career, and I'm sure he will win this one too.\"\n\nOn the issue of Newcastle's sponsorship contracts with three betting companies, manager Howe refused to comment: \"My job is to train the team, manage the team, and that's what I am doing. It is probably better if I stick to these topics.\"\n\nThe Turin prosecutor's office revealed on Tuesday that an investigation is underway against Tonali and his national team mate Nicol\u00f2 Zaniolo from Aston Villa. Both players were officially informed of their involvement in the investigation, and subsequently left the national team to return to their clubs.\n\nAston Villa also confirmed on Friday that Zaniolo is available for the game against West Ham this weekend. According to a club statement, Zaniolo is supporting the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) and the relevant authorities in their investigation into alleged illegal betting activities.\n",

He sees his current situation at Bologna as an opportunity to learn and grow, setting his sights on breaking into the first team this season. Despite facing stiff competition for a midfield spot, Aebischer sees this as a chance to learn and improve.

For the first time since 2003, Ronaldo does not feature among the nominees, although he has won the award in 2008, 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017.

Inter goalkeeper, Andre Onana's (27), value also rises sharply by \u20ac15 million to \u20ac35 million, making him on par with Gregor Kobel (25) or the older Jan Oblak (30) and Marc-Andre ter Stegen (31).\n\nHowever, there are also significant downgrades.

Juventus striker, Federico Chiesa (25), whose season was miserable, is also devalued by \u20ac10 million to \u20ac40 million.\n\nOn the other hand, Hakan Calhanoglu (29) receives an increase of \u20ac5 million to \u20ac40 million after a strong development in the unfamiliar position as a playmaker before the defensive line.

Both keepers faced four penalty kicks in all competitions, saving two and conceding two. However, fourteen other goalkeepers in Europe's top 15 leagues surpass their 50% save rate. Portuguese veteran Marco Pereira (CD Santa Clara), Sergio Herrera (CA Osasuna) and Rafal Gikiewicz (FC Augsburg) have the best records, each saving 75% of penalties faced. Interestingly, David Soria (FC Getafe) and Manuel Riemann (VfL Bochum) have saved the most penalties (three each), but Riemann didn't make the top rank due to his lower overall save percentage \u2013 conceding eight goals from 13 attempts."

                    "Marktwertupdate: Serie-A-Rekord f\u00fcr Osimhen \u2013 Le\u00e3o und Calhanoglu auf Karriereh\u00f6chstwert ": "Serie A has achieved a record market value, following gains in squad value for Champions-League Finalist Inter Milan and the ever-successful SSC Napoli. Napoli has surpassed the 640 million euro mark for the first time since the pre-Corona period with a gain of 11.5 million euros. After Udinese Calcio, Inter is the second biggest winner in the Italian top-flight with a gain of approximately 22 million, reaching 556.4 million euros. This places Inter narrowly ahead of city rivals AC Milan in the Serie A squad value ranking.\n\nKey player Kvaratskhelia is acknowledged for an impressive season, earning individual trophies such as the Serie A MVP award and experiencing a sharp increase in market value. However, his game seems to have slowed down towards the end, possibly due to his lengthy contract duration resulting in less 'buzz' in the transfer market compared to others like Osimhen or Martinez. \n\nIn the Serie A's goalkeeper market value ranking, there have been significant changes at the top. Milan's Mike Maignan remains in front but now emerges onto the world stage after an increase of 10 million to 45 million euros. Inter's goalkeeper, Andr\u00e9 Onana, also saw a considerable increase of 15 million to 35 million euros. \n\nWhile there have been numerous upgrades, there were also significant downgrades for players like Lazio Roma's midfielder Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Inter defender Milan Skriniar, with both experiencing a decrease of 10 million to 50 million euros. Juventus striker Federico Chiesa also saw a downgrade after a forgettable season, going down by 10 million to 40 million euros.\n\nThiaw and Samardzic saw their value rise, while Inter's Robin Gosens, despite returning to the German national team and reaching the Champions League finals, saw a further decrease by 3 million to 15 million euros. Victor Osimhen, the Serie A top scorer, increased his market value again, this time by 20 million to 120 million euros, becoming the most valuable player in Serie A history.",
                    "Marktwerte Italien: Osimhen knackt 100-Mio-Marke \u2013 Pogba auf niedrigstem Wert seit 2013": "After a market value update, which equipped 150 players with new values, the Italian Serie A has not only produced its latest 100-million professionals but also a new top player in terms of squad value. Top scorer Victor Osimhen has broken this milestone while his teammate Khvicha Kvaratskhelia has helped push league leaders and Champions League quarter-finalists SSC Napoli to first place in the league\u2019s squad value ranking. With a squad value of 629 million euros, the club from Campania is now just below the top ten internationally.\n\nThere have been concerns, though, around the form of Juventus striker Vlahovic, whose game has been suffering from injuries and unpredictability. Meanwhile, the significant winners in the Serie A market value update are mostly young players, including 20-year-old Atalanta striker Rasmus H\u00f8jlund, 22-year-old Juventus midfield talent Nicol\u00f2 Fagioli, and 21-year-old former Schalke player Malick Thiaw, who now plays for Milan.\n\nPaul Pogba is the biggest loser of the update. The 30-year-old midfielder has been struggling to find his footing since returning to Juventus. Romelu Lukaku has also suffered a drop in value as he continues to struggle to find his top form.\n\nNigerian striker Osimhen and his Georgian offensive partner Kvaratskhelia are once again the big winners in the Serie A, both in top form for months now. If Osimhen transfers in the summer, it is estimated he will bring in a nine-figure sum with Manchester United, Liverpool and PSG considered the hottest contenders."
