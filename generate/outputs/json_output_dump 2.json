Carrying the hopes of an entire nation on his young shoulders, Miretti is ready to show the world what he, a kid born on August 3, 2003, can achieve.\",\n\"Long\": \"Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to turn our attention to another rising star in the world of football â€“ Fabio Miretti. This 20-year-old Italian sensation isn't just a sensation because he started his career at a young age. Born on August 3, 2003, Miretti has been rapidly making a name for himself in the big, bad world of Italian football. Standing at 179 cm, he's not exactly towering over his opponents, but he's certainly using his height to generate some buzz on the field. Representing his country each time he ties up his cleats, you can hear the whispers of 'Forza Italia' each time he makes a stride on the field. So, let's all sit back and watch as Fabio Miretti attempts to stamp his authority on the beautiful game!\"\n}",

I suppose his 14 starts, out of those appearances, is him showing off his incredible dedication to part-time participation. But hey, let's not forget those 1232 minutes he's played.

While this is a monumental achievement for our star benchwarmer, it's sadly not monumental enough to warrant the captain's armband. Perhaps one day, when Miretti grows up, he'll get to wear the armband. Until then, he can continue warming the bench and dreaming about that armband."

Occasionally, though, he decides to take a break from his rigorous bench-warming schedule and actually gets substituted into the game. And just when we start thinking, 'Wow, Miretti's playing', he's brought back to his natural habitat: the bench, having been taken off an equal number of times he's been put on.

The goal, unfortunately, seems to have a personal vendetta against him, swerving out of the way each time to leave Miretti goalless.

But then again, he does stand an intimidating 182 cm tall, taking that height advantage and using it to dominate the field like he's playing with ant-people.

In October 2020, in an unforeseen and slightly baffling chain of events, Kean was catapulted from Everton's lineup straight into the star-studded glitterati of Paris Saint Germain. You have to give credit where it's due - whether it's a masterstroke of career advancement or a case of 'right place, right time', it's a move guaranteed to keep us armchair critics entertained."
